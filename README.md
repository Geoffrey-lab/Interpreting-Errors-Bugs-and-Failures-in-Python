# Repository Description

## Interpreting Errors, Bugs, and Failures in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on identifying, interpreting, and resolving various types of errors, bugs, and failures encountered in Python programming. It is designed to help developers understand common issues that can arise during coding, as well as effective strategies for testing and debugging. 

### Notebook Contents

1. **Errors, Bugs, Faults, and Failures**:
   - **Types of Errors**: Explanation and examples of different error types, including compile-time, run-time, and logic errors.

2. **Examples of Errors in Python**:
   - **Compile-time Error**: Demonstrates syntax errors detected by the compiler.
     ```python
     product = x y
     ```
   - **Run-time Error**: Showcases errors occurring during program execution.
     ```python
     x = 0
     y = 15/x  # ZeroDivisionError
     ```
   - **Logic Error**: Illustrates errors where the program runs but produces incorrect results.
     ```python
     def add (x, y):
         return x * y
     result = add(5, 3)  # Incorrect logic
     ```

3. **Testing Methods**:
   - **Range Checker**: Function to test input within a specified range.
     ```python
     def range_checker(x):
         """Accepts only integers from 0 to 100, inclusive."""
         if x < 1 or x > 100:
             print("ERROR")
         else:
             print("SUCCESS")
     ```

4. **Testing Strategies**:
   - **Equivalence Classes**: Tests using values from defined equivalence classes.
   - **Boundary Values**: Tests using edge values at the boundary of acceptable input ranges.
   - **Path Testing**: Tests different execution paths in the code.
     ```python
     def decision(a, b):
         if a < 25:
             print("error in a")
         else: 
             print("no error in a")
         if b < 25:
             print("error in b")
         else: 
             print("no error in b")
     ```

5. **Finding Errors**:
   - **Tracing**: Example code illustrating tracing to debug and follow the flow of execution.
     ```python
     y = 7
     x = y * y * 2
     z = x + 5
     print(f'Z equals: {z}')  # Trace instruction
     if z == 13:
         print('I got here')  # Trace instruction
     ```

6. **Using a Debugger**:
   - Guidance on how to utilize debugging tools to step through code, inspect variables, and diagnose issues.

### How to Use This Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine and open the Jupyter Notebook to follow along with the examples. Modify the code snippets to practice and reinforce your understanding of debugging and testing strategies in Python.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interpreting-errors-bugs-failures.git
cd interpreting-errors-bugs-failures
jupyter notebook
```

This repository is an excellent resource for both beginner and intermediate Python developers seeking to improve their debugging skills and understanding of common error types.
